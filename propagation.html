          <p>
            Succulents kept in small pots require frequent maintenance,
            particularly if they do not receive enough light. Insufficient
            sunlight causes the plant to become leggy like this. These plants
            are perfect for propagation!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <div class="number">Step 2</div>
          <img src="images/propagation2.jpg" alt="Propagation 2" />
          <p>
            Although this plant still looks normal from the top, the lower
            leaves will gradually wither and fall off, leaving a long stem with
            a rosette high above the soil. Propagation provides an opportunity
            to make use of these leaves before they start to die.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <div class="number">Step 3</div>
          <img src="images/propagation3.jpg" alt="Propagation 3" />
          <p>
            Start by removing the lower leaves. Be careful when you remove the
            leaves from the stem to ensure a clean break. Hold the leaf gently
            and wiggle it from side to side until I feel a little snap. If you
            tear the leaf or leave the base still attached to the stem, it will
            not be able to grow roots or a new plant.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <div class="number">Step 4</div>
          <img src="images/propagation4.jpg" alt="Propagation 4" />
          <p>
            This is what the leaves will look like if they are pulled cleanly
            from the stem, remaining fully intact.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <div class="number">Step 5</div>
          <img src="images/propagation5.jpg" alt="Propagation 5" />
          <p>
            After you have successfully removed the lower leaves you will be
            left with a small rosette on a long bare stem.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <div class="number">Step 6</div>
          <img src="images/propagation6.jpg" alt="Propagation 6" />
          <p>
            I use a pair of craft scissors, but a sharp knife would work great
            as well. Cut the stem about an inch below the rosette. Make sure
            your cut is as straight as possible.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <div class="number">Step 7</div>
          <img src="images/propagation7.jpg" alt="Propagation 7" />
          <p>
            Now you should have a rosette with a short stem and a long bare stem
            with no rosette. Don’t throw that away! We’ll use that too.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <div class="number">Step 8</div>
          <img src="images/propagation8.jpg" alt="Propagation 8" />
          <p>
            Let the cut ends of your rosette and stem dry out for a few days.
            This is called callousing over and it helps to prevent rot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you feel like the ends are dry enough, you can place them on
            top of some well-draining cactus or succulent soil. (Some people dip
            the ends in a rooting hormone, but I’ve never tried this and have
            had great success without it.) I’ve had the best results when
            keeping my leaves indoors in a window with lots of indirect
            sunlight.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <div class="number">Step 9</div>
          <img src="images/propagation9.jpg" alt="Propagation 9" />
          <p>
            After a few weeks you will see little pink roots sprouting from the
            ends of the leaves and then teeny tiny baby plants will begin to
            grow. I water the leaves very rarely until I start to see roots or
            babies appearing. I like to use a mix of cactus soil and perlite.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <div class="number">Step 10</div>
          <img src="images/propagation10.jpg" alt="Propagation 10" />
          <p>
            Water your cuttings sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out
            completely between waterings. In a few weeks, you should see new
            growth, and eventually, your cuttings will grow into full-sized
            plants! At this point I will give the roots or baby plants a good
            soak about once a week or whenever I notice the soil is totally dry.
            Just like with a fully developed succulent, too much water is not
            good. If you want to be certain not to over water, I recommend
            spraying the ends of your leaves with a spray bottle once a day
            instead of completely soaking the soil.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <div class="number">Step 11</div>
          <img src="images/propagation11.jpg" alt="Propagation 11" />
          <p>
            I let my baby plants grow in rows like this until I start to notice
            the “mother leaf” starting to wither. At that point I will carefully
            remove the leaf in the same fashion I removed it from the original
            stem, and then place the baby plant in its own pot. This can be
            tricky as you don’t want to accidentally remove the roots with the
            leaf, so you may want to play it safe and let the leaf fall off on
            its own.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <div class="number">Step 12</div>
          <img src="images/propagation12.jpg" alt="Propagation 12" />
          <p>
            And here are the new plants that grew from the propagated leaves and
            stem. Succulent propagation is a great way to get more plants for
            free!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <div class="number">Step 13</div>
          <img src="images/propagation13.jpg" alt="Propagation 13" />
          <p>
            Here is another example of a leggy succulent that was propagated.
            You can see the new growth at the base of the plant where the old
            leaves were removed.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <div class="number">Step 14</div>
          <img src="images/propagation14.jpg" alt="Propagation 14" />
          <p>
            Instead of using individual pots with this batch, I just removed the
            leaves as they withered and left the plants to grow together like a
            little succulent forest.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <div class="number">Step 15</div>
          <img src="images/propagation15.jpg" alt="Propagation 15" />
          <p>
            Back to that stump. No part of this plant is going to go to waste!
          </p>
          <p>
            Simply put this pot aside and eventually it will begin to sprout new
            plants from each place we removed a leaf!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <div class="number">Step 16</div>
          <img src="images/propagation16.jpg" alt="Propagation 16" />
          <p>
            Now back to our original plant, the reason we did all this! Once the
            stem has dried out and calloused over, simply place your plant back
            in a pot with well-draining cactus or succulent soil and it will
            grow roots again and continue to flourish!
